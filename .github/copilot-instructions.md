# HSI-Biopsy Project Instructions

This is a scientific/research project focused on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis of biopsy samples.

## Project Context
- This project uses Python for data processing and analysis of hyperspectral imaging data
- The codebase likely includes functions for image processing, feature extraction, and machine learning
- The project may include visualization tools for medical imaging data
- Consider best practices for medical/scientific data processing when suggesting code

## Coding Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Use NumPy docstring format for function and class documentation
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Prefer established scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, scikit-image, etc.) when possible

## Data Handling
- Assume HSI data is stored in standard formats (HDF5, NumPy arrays, etc.)
- Ensure data processing maintains provenance and traceability
- Follow best practices for medical data privacy
